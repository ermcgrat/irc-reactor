# Some explanation regarding all of the color codes seen used below
# a color code is started with \x03 and it should then ALWAYS be followed by a 2-digit color code. However, they frequently just use the shorthand of a 1-digit color code. E.g. for light red: \x034Hello!
# This could cause an issue if the text to be displayed then started with a number, as that first digit would be interpreted as part of the color code.
# So instead of \x034 for red, you should use \x0304. These will both produce the same exact color, but the latter eliminates risk of text becoming part of the color code.
# Color code according to mIRC: 0 - White, 1 - Black, 2 - Blue, 3 - Green, 4 - Light Red, 5 - Brown, 6 - Purple, 7 - Orange, 8 - Yellow, 9 - Light Green, 10 - Cyan, 11 - Light Cyan, 12 - Light Blue, 13 - Pink, 14 - Grey, 15 - Light Grey
# It seems like you can just keep specifying 2-digit color codes all the way up to 99, and each client treats them differently.
# It's also important to note colors will persist until cleared. \x03 will clear color formatting (foreground and background both).
# Foreground (FF) and background (BB): \x03FF,BB  E.g yellow text on red background: \x0308,04Hello
# An example of not cancelling color formatting: \x0300,01Hello \x0301to you
# The word "Hello" is "White on black", and "to you" is "black on black", as it inherits the black background from the first code.
