red: \00304
green: \00303
aqua: \00310
yellow/orange: \00307
blue: \00312
pink: \00345

note, while this worked in the old tcl script, javascript doesn't allow for "octal literals", which those above get interpreted as.
So instead we use \x, eg:
red: \x0304

\x02	bold
\x03	colored text
\x1D	italic text
\x1F	underlined text
\x16	swap background and foreground colors ("reverse video")
\x0F	reset all formatting

# Some explanation regarding all of the color codes seen used below
# a color code is started with \003 and it should then ALWAYS be followed by a 2-digit color code. However, they frequently just use the shorthand of a 1-digit color code. E.g. for light red: \0034Hello!
# This could cause an issue if the text to be displayed then started with a number, as that first digit would be interpreted as part of the color code.
# So instead of \0034 for red, you should use \00304. These will both produce the same exact color, but the latter eliminates risk of text becoming part of the color code.
# Color code according to mIRC: 0 - White, 1 - Black, 2 - Blue, 3 - Green, 4 - Light Red, 5 - Brown, 6 - Purple, 7 - Orange, 8 - Yellow, 9 - Light Green, 10 - Cyan, 11 - Light Cyan, 12 - Light Blue, 13 - Pink, 14 - Grey, 15 - Light Grey
# It seems like you can just keep specifying 2-digit color codes all the way up to 99, and each client treats them differently.
# It's also important to note colors will persist until cleared. \003 will clear color formatting (foreground and background both).
# Foreground (FF) and background (BB): \003FF,BB  E.g yellow text on red background: \00308,04Hello
# An example of not cancelling color formatting: \00300,01Hello \00301to you
# The word "Hello" is "White on black", and "to you" is "black on black", as it inherits the black background from the first code.
